I started Freestyle Home Systems, Ltd. in 2001 as a custom residential electronics integration company. 14 years later, after delving into the world of commercial solutions, we became Freestyle A/V to offer the best of both worlds.

Custom home electronic and entertainment systems require careful planning. We take great care to consider all aspects of your specific needs during this process to create a system that will meet those needs but also exceed your expectations!

Installations can vary depending on the complexity of the system and we will work with your schedule to complete your single or multi-day installation in a timely manner. Control is a very personal part of your system and we'll tailor the control to fit your personal style.

Our work doesn't end when the installation is complete. We will be here to support you and your system in the future, whether you need technical or warranty support, we're just a phone call away!
